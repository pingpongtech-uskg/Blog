## Hello, I'm the User

I am a **Solution Engineer** specializing in Cyber Security, based in [City/Country]. With over [X] years of experience, I bridge the gap between complex technical security challenges and business solutions. 
My passion lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Technology**, where I explore how AI agents can revolutionize security operations (and sometimes break them!).

This blog, **PingPongTech**, is my digital garden. It's where I document my learning journey, share technical tutorials, and offer insights into the future of tech.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
*   **Security**: SIEM, SOAR, Zero Trust Architecture, Cloud Security (AWS/Azure).
*   **AI/ML**: LLM Integration, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LangChain.
*   **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD Pipelines, Hugo (of course!).
*   **Languages**: Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript.

### 🎯 What I Write About
On this blog, you'll find content categorized into:
1.  **Cybersecurity Deep Dives**: Analyzing recent CVEs, defense strategies, and blue team tactics.
2.  **AI Experiments**: Building agents, fines-tuning models, and ethical AI discussions.
3.  **Tech Tutorials**: "How-to" guides for tools like VS Code, Linux, and Cloudflare.

### 📬 Get in Touch
I'm always open to discussing new projects, speaking opportunities, or just geeking out over the latest tech.
